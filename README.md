# ZapRide
## Description
ZapRide is a smart carpooling platform built to bridge the gap between drivers with empty seats and passengers looking for a convenient, cost-effective ride. The platform not only promotes shared commuting but also contributes to reducing urban traffic congestion and lowering environmental impact through fewer vehicles on the road.

Crafted with the MERN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js â€” ZapRide delivers a fast, reliable, and responsive user experience. Users can easily sign up as either a rider or a driver, publish or book trips, and track journeys in real-time. The application features JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, Google Maps integration for route visualization, and dynamic fare calculation based on distance and time.

ZapRide is designed with a strong focus on usability, offering clean UI components, intuitive navigation, and real-time updates powered by WebSockets. By encouraging ride-sharing among trusted users, it aims to build a connected travel community while supporting environmental sustainability.
